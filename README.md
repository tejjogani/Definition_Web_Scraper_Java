# Definition_Web_Scraper_Java
This has a java program which scrapes google first and then wikipedia for definitions on any input word, and then outputs a PDF with word : definition, which reduces development time.
It's probably a little slow, which is why, I'd love developers to help me find fater ways to accomplish the tasks which I am currently accomplishing. Also, I made this because I couldn't find a stable dictionary API.
\n
In the folder "DefineMe" we have the inputfiles the output and the source code. The input files has a file called "words.txt" where we type the words we want defined on different lines. (See the file in order to understand)
\n
The output.pdf is where the definition pdf is created. See the files to get a gist.
