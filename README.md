# Definition_Web_Scraper_Java
This has a java program which scrapes google first and then wikipedia for definitions on any input word, and then outputs a PDF with word : definition, which reduces development time.
It's probably a little slow, which is why, I'd love developers to help me find fater ways to accomplish the tasks which I am currently accomplishing.
